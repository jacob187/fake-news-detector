### Introduction

This web application leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to detect and classify news as either 'real' or 'fake'. It utilizes a trained machine learning model that has been fine-tuned on a large dataset. The model evaluates the textual content input by the user and makes a prediction about its authenticity.

The underlying AI model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand the semantic and syntactic patterns in the text. It then compares these patterns with those it learned during training from both genuine and deceptive news articles.

To use this application, simply input a block of text into the provided text area and click 'Submit'. The AI model will then process the text and provide a classification along with a confidence score. The confidence score represents the model's certainty about its prediction, with higher values indicating greater certainty.

This application serves as a powerful tool in the ongoing fight against misinformation, providing a quick and reliable way to verify the authenticity of news articles.
